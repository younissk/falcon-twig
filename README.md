# Falcon-Twig

Falcon-Twig is a fine-tuning project for a Falcon H1 7B model on Tool calling.

To train, simply run:

```
make train
```

Sadly it underperformed the normal instruct model even on tool calling, making it kinda useless in production, but still valuable for insights of what went wrong.
